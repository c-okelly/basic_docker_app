# Build image and tag as latest
docker build -t simple-flask-app:latest .

# Run image
docker run -p 8000:5000 simple-flask-app


# How docker compose works
version
services => general
create a service
build vs pull image

Mention networking / connecting other images
running in swarm vs single cluster

# Run docker compose
docker-compose up

# .env files
# Doesn't work in swarm
